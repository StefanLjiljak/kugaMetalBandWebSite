            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>The Kuga is a Belgrade heavy metal band formed in 2003. Their first appearance was held at the Belgrade
                Holiday Club in May of the same year when they performed a couple of their own and several other songs.
                At the very beginning Kuga functions as an author group and creates the first author's compositions in
                Serbian language modeled after the world heavy-speed-thrash metal bands of the 80s. </p>
            <p>
                During this period, the Kuga triggers
                an old-fashioned spirit of ex-Yu metal that has been unfairly neglected for years. According to older
                metalworkers from that period, The Kuga is almost the only true representative of thrash / speed / heavy
                metal with lyrics in Serbian and the group that is the first and perhaps the only one to continue the
                path of legendary ex-Yu metal bands singing in their native language namely: Heller, Bombarder,
                Pargament, Gordy, Divlje Jagode, Dr. Steel and others who played 15-20 years before the Kuga. In the
                period 2003-2005 the band changed its almost complete lineup with the exception of singer Bojan Ljiljak,
                who is still the most recognizable member of the band today.
            </p>
            <p>
                During this period the band played many concerts in Serbia with local bands as well as a 2005 concert at
                SKC in Belgrade with the French death metal band Bloody Sign. At the time, while the guitarist was still
                Nemanja Djordjevic, Kuga left behind a few different demos and live recordings, but because of the bad
                recordings and production, they were not officially released. Some of the Kuga's first compositions were
                Malice, Time has come, Final Scream, etc. At the beginning of 2005, the lineup stabilized, and for the
                next 10 years the Kuga functioned unchanged: Bojan Ljiljak - vocals, Marko Zegarac - guitar, Milos
                Pavlovic bass and Nikola Zoric - drum.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2006, Kuga performed as a pre-band for the band Tankard at SKC-Belgrade, and at the end of the same
                year, the band recorded the first serious material "Kuga-Live from Belgrade 2006". . In addition to the
                frequent appearances of 2007, they also promote "Live in Belgrade 2006" material on the Belgrade 202
                radio after their performance in Zajecar in the same year on Hit 202. Four compositions from the
                beginning of the career were omitted.
            </p>
            <p>
                2007 was followed by an appearance at the Exit festival when Kuga performed just before the band UDO,
                and the following year the band would record the single Sila Zla, marking 5 years of work and
                performance, when the famous guitarist Ljubisa Racic (ex -Bijelo Dugme and Formula 4).
            </p>
            <p>
                "The Darkest Nights" debut album was recorded in 2008/2009 in studio 5 of the PGP-RTS, and the complete
                mastering and production were completed in 2010, but it was expected to be released until 2011 when the
                collaboration with Mexican record company Sade records was made. With the songs '' Lost Soul '' and ''
                In the World of Deception '' the band also takes part in the filming of the Serbian horror film ''Crna
                Zorica''. The release of the album is followed by a concert promotion and the premiere of the movie Crna
                Zorica at the Sava Center, where a complete band as part of the film crew is on stage. After the release
                of his first album, The Kuga first started working as a five-member band with two guitarists. In the
                coming period, new guitarists Danilo Orbovic and Andrija Grozdanovic will be replaced in the position of
                the second rhythm of the guitar 3-4 times.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kuga's first album is accompanied by a promotion and a mini tour 2011-2012, which included 10 cities
                across Serbia, and several countries in the region such as Bulgaria, Bosnia, Macedonia, etc.…. At that
                point, the Kuga is already making an enviable number of appearances. During 2011/2012, the group is
                slowly starting to work on new material, collectively called '' Fire In Us ''. In 2013, the Kuga in
                Bozidarac Hall in Belgrade marks 10 years of work with the support of the Granulom bands from Sofia and
                the Grotesque band from Belgrade. The year 2014 is very significant because the band is also making an
                important appearance in Croatia at the Underwall Festival in Zadar, where they have performed with big
                names from the heavy metal world such as Sepultura, Enslaved, Benediction Blaze Baley..., as well as for
                the second time with the Tankard group. Then the group finishes the set of songs and arrangements for
                the 2 album and functions unchanged until the end of 2015. Before entering the studio to record second
                album with the band, the lineup changes.

                The long rhythm section of Milos Pavlovic - bass and Nikola Zoric - drum is replaced by Nikola
                Marinkovic and Boris Jeric... In the lineup Bojan Ljiljak - vocal, Marko Zegarac - guitar, Nikola
                Marinkovic bass, Boris Jeric - drum, the band finishes recording second album Fire on Us. In this play,

                through the agency Route 011, the group also performs at the Belgrade Riot Festival together with
                significant local metal and punk bands. After plotting to record 2 materials, longtime guitarist Marko
                Zegarac leaves the band as well as his place of residence. Shortly after, the band also left drummer
                Boris Jeric. They will soon be replaced by guitarist Uros Andrijasevic (ex-Draconic) and drummer Sergej

                Devil Me and You '' as a sort of announcement of the album Fire in Us. Finally, at the beginning of
                2018, the band signed a contract to a Belgrade record label One Records for both Kuga albums. Since the
                album Blackest Night was released back in 2011 and the circulation was sold long ago, the publisher
